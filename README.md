# Brief
 
This project -- *Ode to Plywood* -- reflects the work of the GIZMO (physical computing) module at Imperial College London Design Engineering. The brief required us to create **human interaction with a 'robot'** using plywood. I decided to create a robotic arm and for the interaction, make it detect and track faces. The arm could also extensively be controlled by an infrared remote. 

## Construction of Arm

### Inspiration

Before building the arm, I got inspiration from the numerous 3d printed arms available online. I drew most of my design from [this](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/diy-arduino-robot-arm-with-smartphone-control/) project involving the arm control through a smartphone. 

### Prototyping and CAD

Before cutting the plywood sheets I needed to understand how to transform the 3d printed cad into an arm made of plywood. For this, prototyping with cardboard helped mainly with understanding how to hold the servomotors.
